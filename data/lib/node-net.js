/**
 * Remoted network API that tries to look like node.js's "net" API.  We are
 * expected/required to run in a worker thread where we don't have direct
 * access to mozTCPSocket so everything has to get remitted to the main thread.
 * Our counterpart is mailapi/worker-support/net-main.js
 *
 *
 * ## Sending lots of data: flow control, Blobs ##
 *
 * mozTCPSocket provides a flow-control mechanism (the return value to send
 * indicates whether we've crossed a buffering boundary and 'ondrain' tells us
 * when all buffered data has been sent), but does not yet support enqueueing
 * Blobs for processing (which is part of the proposed standard at
 * http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/raw-sockets/).  Also, the raw-sockets spec
 * calls for generating the 'drain' event once our buffered amount goes back
 * under the internal buffer target rather than waiting for it to hit zero like
 * mozTCPSocket.
 *
 * Our main desire right now for flow-control is to avoid using a lot of memory
 * and getting killed by the OOM-killer.  As such, flow control is not important
 * to us if we're just sending something that we're already keeping in memory.
 * The things that will kill us are giant things like attachments (or message
 * bodies we are quoting/repeating, potentially) that we are keeping as Blobs.
 *
 * As such, rather than echoing the flow-control mechanisms over to this worker
 * context, we just allow ourselves to write() a Blob and have the net-main.js
 * side take care of streaming the Blobs over the network.
 *
 * Note that successfully sending a lot of data may entail holding a wake-lock
 * to avoid having the network device we are using turned off in the middle of
 * our sending.  The network-connection abstraction is not currently directly
 * involved with the wake-lock management, but I could see it needing to beef up
 * its error inference in terms of timeouts/detecting disconnections so we can
 * avoid grabbing a wi-fi wake-lock, having our connection quietly die, and then
 * we keep holding the wi-fi wake-lock for much longer than we should.
 *
 * ## Supported API Surface ##
 *
 * We make sure to expose the following subset of the node.js API because we
 * have consumers that get upset if these do not exist:
 *
 * Attributes:
 * - encrypted (false, this is not the tls byproduct)
 * - destroyed
 *
 * Methods:
 * - setKeepAlive(Boolean)
 * - write(Buffer)
 * - end
 *
 * Events:
 * - "connect"
 * - "close"
 * - "end"
 * - "data"
 * - "error"

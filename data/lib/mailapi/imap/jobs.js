/**
 * Abstractions for dealing with the various mutation operations.
 *
 * NB: Moves discussion is speculative at this point; we are just thinking
 * things through for architectural implications.
 *
 * == Speculative Operations ==
 *
 * We want our UI to update as soon after requesting an operation as possible.
 * To this end, we have logic to locally apply queued mutation operations.
 * Because we may want to undo operations when we are offline (and have not
 * been able to talk to the server), we also need to be able to reflect these
 * changes locally independent of telling the server.
 *
 * In the case of moves/copies, we issue a(n always locally created) id for the
 * message immediately and just set the server UID (srvid) to 0 to be populated
 * by the sync process.
 *
 * == Data Integrity ==
 *
 * Our strategy is always to avoid server data-loss, so data-destruction actions
 * must always take place after successful confirmation of persistence actions.
 * (Just keeping the data in-memory is not acceptable because we could crash,
 * etc.)
 *
 * This is in contrast to our concern about losing simple, frequently performed
 * idempotent user actions in a crash.  We assume that A) crashes will be
 * rare, B) the user will not be surprised or heart-broken if a message they
 * marked read a second before a crash needs to manually be marked read after
 * restarting the app/device, and C) there are performance/system costs to
 * saving the state which makes this a reasonable trade-off.
 *
 * It is also our strategy to avoid cluttering up the place as a side-effect
 * of half-done things.  For example, if we are trying to move N messages,
 * but only copy N/2 because of a timeout, we want to make sure that we
 * don't naively retry and then copy those first N/2 messages a second time.
 * This means that we track sub-steps explicitly, and that operations that we
 * have issued and may or may not have been performed by the server will be
 * checked before they are re-attempted.  (Although IMAP batch operations
 * are atomic, and our IndexedDB commits are atomic, they are atomic independent
 * of each other and so we could have been notified that the copy completed
 * but not persisted the fact to our database.)
 *
 * In the event we restore operations from disk that were enqueued but
 * apparently not run, we compel them to run a check operation before they are
 * performed because it's possible (depending on the case) for us to have run
 * them without saving the account state first.  This is a trade-off between the
 * cost of checking and the cost of issuing commits to the database frequently
 * based on the expected likelihood of a crash on our part.  Per comments above,
 * we expect crashes to be rare and not particularly correlated with operations,
 * so it's better for the device (both flash and performance) if we don't
 * continually checkpoint our state.
 *
 * All non-idempotent operations / operations that could result in data loss or
 * duplication require that we save our account state listing the operation and
 * that it is 'doing'.  In the event of a crash, this allows us to know that we
 * have to check the state of the operation for completeness before attempting
 * to run it again and allowing us to finish half-done things.  For particular
 * example, because moves consist of a copy followed by flagging a message
 * deleted, it is of the utmost importance that we don't get in a situation
 * where we have copied the messages but not deleted them and we crash.  In
 * that case, if we failed to persist our plans, we will have duplicated the
 * message (and the IMAP server would have no reason to believe that was not
 * our intent.)

  // move: Move messages between folders (in a single account)
  //
  // ## General Strategy ##
  //
  // Local Do:
  //
  // - Move the header to the target folder's storage.
  //
  //   This requires acquiring a write mutex to the target folder while also
  //   holding one on the source folder.  We are assured there is no deadlock
  //   because only operations are allowed to manipulate multiple folders at
  //   once, and only one operation is in-flight per an account at a time.
  //   (And cross-account moves are not handled by this operation.)
  //
  //   Insertion is done using the INTERNALDATE (which must be maintained by the
  //   COPY operation) and a freshly allocated speculative UID.  The UID is
  //
  // ## Possible Problems and their Solutions ##
  //
  // Moves are fairly complicated in terms of moving parts, so let's enumate the
  // way things could go wrong so we can make sure we address them and describe
  // how we address them.  Note that it's a given that we will have run our
  // local modifications prior to trying to talk to the server, which reduces
  // the potential badness.
  //
  // #1: We attempt to resynchronize the source folder for a move prior to
  //     running the operation against the server, resulting in us synchronizing
  //     a duplicate header into existence that will not be detected until the
  //     next resync of the time range (which will be strictly after when we
  //     actually run the mutation.
  //
  // #2: Operations scheduled against speculative headers.  It is quite possible
  //     for the user to perform actions against one of the locally /
  //     speculatively moved headers while we are offline/have not yet played
  //     the operation/are racing the UI while playing the operation.  We
  //     obviously want these changes to succeed.
  //
  // Our solutions:
  //
  // #1: Prior to resynchronizing a folder, we check if there are any operations
  //     that block synchronization.  An un-run move with a source of that
  //     folder counts as such an operation.  We can determine this by either
  //     having sufficient knowledge to inspect an operation or have operations
  //     directly modify book-keeping structures in the folders as part of their
  //     actions.  (Add blocker on local_(un)do, remove on (un)do.)  We choose
  //     to implement the inspection operation by having all operations
  //     implement a simple helper to tell us if the operation blocks entry.
  //     The theory is this will be less prone to bugs since it will be clear
  //     that operations need to implement the method, whereas it would be less
  //     clear that operations need to do call the folder-state mutating
  //     options.
  //
  // #2: Operations against speculative headers are a concern only from a naming
  //     perspective for operations.  Operations are strictly run in the order
  //     they are enqueued, so we know that the header will have been moved and
  //     be in the right folder.  Additionally, because both the UI and
  //     operations name messages using an id we issue rather than the server
  //     UID, there is no potential for naming inconsistencies.  The UID will be
  //     resolved at operation run-time which only requires that the move was
  //     UIDPLUS so we already know the UID, something else already triggered a
  //     synchronization that covers the messages being moved, or that we

/**
 * Abstraction around the mailcomposer helper library and our efforts to avoid
 * filling up the device's memory and crashing when we send large messages.  We
 * produce a Blob that is made up of some combination of strings and Blobs.
 *
 * ## Composer Endpoints ##
 *
 * There are 3 main endpoints for our data:
 *
 * 1) SMTP transmission.  SMTP does not require us to know the size of what we
 * are sending up front.  It usually does NOT want the BCC header included in
 * the message.
 *
 * 2) IMAP APPEND.  APPEND needs to know the size of the message we are
 * appending up front.  It DOES want the BCC header included for archival
 * purposes, so this needs to be a different body.
 *
 * 3) ActiveSync sending.  There are actually two paths here; ActiveSync <= 12.x
 * does a more traditional POST of just the MIME data.  ActiveSync >= 14.0
 * generates a WBXML command, but it's basically just a wrapper around the MIME
 * data.  Because we use XHR's to communicate with the server, the size
 * effectively needs to be known ahead of time.
 *
 * ## The Data ##
 *
 * The actual data that goes into our message is either finite-ish (headers),
 * variable in size but arguably manageable (the contents of the message), or
 * potentially very large in size (attachments).  Besides being potentially
 * huge, attachments are also notable because they are immutable once attached.
 * Also, they arguably need to be redundantly stored once attached.  That is,
 * if a user attaches an image from DeviceStorage and then later deletes it
 * before the message is sent, you can make a convincing case that the
 * attachment should still be sent with the message.  Previously, this would
 * happen as a side-effect of IndexedDB's need to duplicate the contents of
 * Blobs passed into it so it could persist them and manage its life-cycle.
 *
 * @param newRecords
 *   The HeaderInfo and BodyInfo for the most recent saved copy of the draft.

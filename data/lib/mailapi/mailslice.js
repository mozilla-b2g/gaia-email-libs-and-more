/**
 * Presents a message-centric view of a slice of time from IMAP search results.
 *
 * == Use-case assumptions
 *
 * - We are backing a UI showing a list of time-ordered messages.  This can be
 *   the contents of a folder, on-server search results, or the
 *   (server-facilitated) list of messages in a conversation.
 * - We want to fetch more messages as the user scrolls so that the entire
 *   contents of the folder/search results list are available.
 * - We want to show the message as soon as possible.  So we can show a message
 *   in the list before we have its snippet.  However, we do want the
 *   bodystructure before we show it so we can accurately know if it has
 *   attachments.
 * - We want to update the state of the messages in real-time as we hear about
 *   changes from the server, such as another client starring a message or
 *   marking the message read.
 * - We will synchronize some folders with either a time and/or message count
 *   threshold.
 * - We want mutations made locally to appear as if they are applied
 *   immediately, even if we are operating offline.
 *
 * == Efficiency desires
 *
 * - Avoid redundant network traffic by caching our results using IndexedDB.
 * - Keep the I/O burden and overhead low from caching/sync.  We know our
 *   primary IndexedDB implementation is backed by SQLite with full
 *   transaction commits corresponding to IndexedDB transaction commits.
 *   We also know that all IndexedDB work gets marshaled to another thread.
 *   Since the server is the final word in state, except for mutations we
 *   trigger, we don't need to be aggressive about persisting state.
 *   Accordingly, let's persist our data in big blocks only on major
 *   transitions (folder change) or when our memory usage is getting high.
 *   (If we were using LevelDB, large writes would probably be less
 *   desirable.)
 *
 * == Of slices, folders, and gmail
 *
 * It would be silly for a slice that is for browsing the folder unfiltered and
 * a slice that is a result of a search to act as if they were dealing with
 * different messages.  Similarly, it would be silly in gmail for us to fetch
 * a message that we know is the same message across multiple (labels as)
 * folders.  So we abstract away the storage details to `FolderStorage`.
 *
 * == Latency, offline access, and IMAP
 *
 * The fundamental trade-off is between delaying showing things in the UI and
 * showing them and then having a bunch of stuff happen a split-second later.
 * (Messages appearing, disappearing, having their status change, etc.)

 * === Batching ===
 *
 * We do a few different types of batching based on the current sync state,
 * with these choices being motivated by UX desires and some efficiency desires
 * (in pursuit of improved UX).  We want the user to feel like they get their
 * messages quickly, but we also don't want messages jumping all over the
 * screen.
 *
 * - Fresh sync (all messages are new to us): Messages are being added from
 *   most recent to oldest.  Currently, we just let this pass through, but
 *   we might want to do some form of limited time-based batching.  (ex:
 *   wait 50ms or for notification of completion before sending a batch).
 *
 * - Refresh (sync): No action required because we either already have the
 *   messages or get them in efficient-ish batches.  This is followed by
 *   what should be minimal changes (and where refresh was explicitly chosen
 *   to be used rather than date sync for this reason.)
 *
 * - Date sync (some messages are new, some messages are known):  We currently
 *   get the known headers added one by one from youngest to oldest, followed
 *   by the new messages also youngest to oldest.  The notional UX (enforced
 *   by unit tests) for this is that we want all the changes coherently and with
 *   limits made effective.  To this end, we do not generate any splices until
 *   sync is complete and then generate a single slice.

/**
 * Per-folder message caching/storage named by their UID.  Storage also relies
 * on the IMAP internaldate of the message for efficiency.  Accordingly,
 * when performing a lookup, we either need the exact date of the message or
 * a reasonable bounded time range in which it could fall (which should be a
 * given for date range scans).
 *
 * Storage is done using IndexedDB, with message header information and message
 * body information stored in separate blocks of information.  Blocks are
 * loaded on demand, although preferably hints are received so we can pre-load
 * information.
 *
 * Blocks are discarded from memory (and written back if mutated) when there are
 * no longer live `ImapSlice` instances that care about the time range and we
 * are experiencing memory pressure.  Dirty blocks are periodically written
 * to storage even if there is no memory pressure at notable application and
 * synchronization state milestones.  Since the server is the canonical message
 * store, we are not exceedingly concerned about losing state.
 *
 * Messages are discarded from storage when experiencing storage pressure.  We
 * figure it's better to cache what we have until it's known useless (deleted
 * messages) or we definitely need the space for something else.
 *
 * == Concurrency and I/O
 *
 * The logic in this class can operate synchronously as long as the relevant
 * header/body blocks are in-memory.  For simplicity, we (asynchronously) defer
 * execution of calls that mutate state while loads are in-progress; callers
 * will not block.  This simplifies our implementation and thinking about our
 * implementation without making life for our users much worse.
 *
 * Specifically, all UI requests for data will be serviced immediately if the
 * data is available.  If the data is not available, the wait would have
 * happened anyways.  Mutations will be enqueued, but are always speculatively
 * assumed to succeed by the UI anyways so when they are serviced is not
 * exceedingly important other than a burden on us to surface in the UI that
 * we still have some state to synchronize to the server so the user does
 * not power-off their phone quite yet.

  /**
   * Find the right block to insert a header/body into using its date and UID.
   * This is an asynchronous operation because we potentially need to load
   * blocks from disk.
   *
   * == Usage patterns
   *
   * - In initial-sync cases and scrolling down through the list, we will
   *   generate messages from a younger-to-older direction.  The insertion point
   *   will then likely occur after the last block.
   * - In update-sync cases, we should be primarily dealing with new mail which
   *   is still retrieved endTS to startTS.  The insertion point will start
   *   before the first block and then move backwards within that block.
   * - Update-sync cases may also encounter messages moved into the folder
   *   from other folders since the last sync.  An archive folder is the
   *   most likely case for this, and we would expect random additions with a
   *   high degree of clustering on message date.
   * - Update-sync cases may experience a lot of apparent message deletion due
   *   to actual deletion or moves to other folders.  These can shrink blocks
   *   and we need to consider block merges to avoid pathological behavior.
   * - Forgetting messages that are no longer being kept alive by sync settings
   *   or apparent user interest.  There's no benefit to churn for the sake of
   *   churn, so we can just forget messages in blocks wholesale when we
   *   experience disk space pressure (from ourselves or elsewhere).  In that
   *   case we will want to traverse from the startTS messages, dropping them and
   *   consolidating blocks as we go until we have freed up enough space.
   *
   * == General strategy
   *
   * - If we fall in an existing block and it won't overflow, use it.
   * - If we fall in an existing block and it would overflow, split it.
   * - If we fall outside existing blocks, check older and newer blocks in that
   *   order for a non-overflow fit.  If we would overflow, pick the existing
   *   block further from the center to perform a split.
   * - If there are no existing blocks at all, create a new one.
   * - When splitting, if we are the first or last block, split 2/3 towards the
   *   center and 1/3 towards the edge.  The idea is that growth is most likely
   *   to occur near the edges, so concentrate the empty space there without
   *   leaving the center blocks so overloaded they can't accept random
   *   additions without further splits.
   * - When splitting, otherwise, split equally-ish.
   *
   * == Block I/O
   *
   * While we can make decisions about where to insert things, we need to have
   * blocks in memory in order to perform the actual splits.  The outcome
   * of splits can't be predicted because the size of things in blocks is
   * only known when the block is loaded.

   *
   * 2) Use our knowledge of the messages in the folder to issue a sync request
   *    over the time range that we think will net us a reasonable number of
   *    messages, only displaying any messages once the sync over that time
   *    range completes.
   *
   * 3) (Act like) we know nothing about the messages in the folder, issuing
   *    an initial sync request over `daysDesired`/`INITIAL_SYNC_DAYS`, and
   *    issuing successive sync requests back further in time as we go,
   *    adjusting the size of the sync requests as we go.
   *
   * If we are offline, we basically do #1 but without triggering a refresh.
   *
   * The strategies we use are controlled via constants that are documented in

   * stop, and leave the caller to re-issue a request to trigger #2.
   *
   * 2) Issue a sync request for a fresh new time range, leaving it to
   * `onSyncCompleted` to keep searching further back in time as needed.

  /**
   * General setup:
   *
   * - Create Nsync messages spread over 3 sync intervals, the first of which is
   *   6 sync intervals in the past (but more recent than the old threshold).
   *   Also create Nsync messages further back in time before those that we
   *   never get to, but which are there to get accidentally synced if we screw
   *   up.
   *
   * (We alter time by changing when the perceived value of 'now' is.  All
   *  code does TIME_WARPED_NOW || Date.now() rather than just Date.now().  To
   *  avoid needlessly breaking our logic we only ever increase the time value.)
   *
   * "nothing has changed since last time"
   *
   * - Perform an initial open sync which does our deepening strategy.
   * - Perform an open sync within the #1 time interval, verifying that it
   *   manifests as a #1 refresh.
   * - Perform an open sync outside the #1 time interval but within the #2
   *   time interval, verifying that it manifests as a known date range sync.
   * - Perform an open sync outside both time intervals, verifying that it
   *   manifests as our standard deepening probe.
   * - Warp time so that the messages fall under the "old" threshold, perform
   *   an open sync, verify that the #1 refresh strategy happens.
   *
   * "minimal changes we expected have happened"
   *
   * - Add a message, verify a #1 open refresh with the new message coming
   *   last.  This will be an 'old' message.
   * - Add another message, verify a #1 open refresh with one less message
   *   off the 'old' side and the new message coming last.
   * - Add another message, verify a #2 date sync with the new message coming
   *   first because it is newest and this was a sync.
   * - Add another message, verify a #2 date sync with the new message first
   *   and one less message on the 'old' side.
   * (No need to check that the deepening fallback happens.)
   *
   *
   * "oh no, lots of new messages"
   *
   * - Adjust overflow values, create a new folder with the same heuristics
   *   as before.
   * - Perform initial deepening sync.
   * - Add enough messages to trigger overflow conditions on the refresh and
   *   a subsequent naive date sync for expanding the range.
   * - Perform a #1-qualifying open, observe the initial set of messages
   *   followed by some of the overflow messages, and the retraction of the
   *   initial set of messages because our sync no longer reaches them.
   * - (We now have two islands of synchronized data.  The original fully
   *   synced interval, plus the new deepended interval, with a gap in between.
   *   This raises semantics issues for atBottom, but we define that the answer
   *   is we are not at the bottom and we will perform the extra sync required
   *   to link us up with our friends.  However, a distinct grow request is
   *   still required to trigger the network traffic.)
   * - Grow in the older direction, and verify that this appears to result in
   *   an overflow case that gets bisected down.
   *
   * - Create another new folder.
   * - Perform initial deepening sync.
   * - Add enough messages to trigger overflow conditions.
   * - Perform a #2 qualifying open, observe that we get some of the overflow
   *   messages and never see the older messages.

   * NB: This test originally tested our much more complicated sync logic,
   * and has been simplified, but not re-written from scratch.  So some things
   * like time-warps that seem like they have real intent behind them are no
   * longer of great concern.
   *
   * General setup:
   *
   * - Create Nsync messages spread over 3 sync intervals, the first of which is
   *   6 sync intervals in the past (but more recent than the old threshold).
   *   Also create Nsync messages further back in time before those that we
   *   never get to, but which are there to get accidentally synced if we screw
   *   up.
   *
   * (We alter time by changing when the perceived value of 'now' is.  All
   *  code does TIME_WARPED_NOW || Date.now() rather than just Date.now().  To
   *  avoid needlessly breaking our logic we only ever increase the time value.)
   *
   * "nothing has changed since last time"
   *
   * - Perform an initial open sync which does our deepening strategy.
   * - Perform an open without having exceeded the refresh threshold; verify
   *   that we get the contents of the folder without using our network
   *   connection.
   * - Time jump, perform an open, verify that a refresh happens.
   * - Big time jump, perform an open sync, verifying this is still a refresh
   *   too.  (This is largely a holdover from our old tests, but does help
   *   ensure our old heuristics are dead.)
   *
   * "minimal changes we expected have happened"
   *
   * - Add a message.
   * - Verify that a slice open without having crossed the threshold only tells
   *   us about what we already know about and there is no network traffic.
   * - Timewarp so we want to refresh, open the slice, verify a refresh with the
   *   new message coming last.
   * - Add another message, verify a sync refresh with still only fill-size
   *   retrieved and the new message coming last.
   *
   *
   * "oh no, lots of new messages"
   *
   * - Adjust overflow values, create a new folder with the same heuristics
   *   as before.
   * - Perform initial deepening sync.
   * - Add enough messages to trigger overflow conditions on the refresh and
   *   a subsequent naive date sync for expanding the range.
   * - Add an extra message that's older than
   * - Perform a refreshing open; observe the aborted refresh sync which is
   *   replaced by a series of smaller syncs along the lines of a deepening
   *   sync.  The main difference is that our bisection logic is used to
   *   determine how many days we start out with.

 * - The overfull on a single day case with growth afterwards.  There was a bug

 *   that would result in SINCE (day) BEFORE (day).  This is a null set on
 *   servers like dovecot, but gmail interprets it to mean it should return all

 * the folder (or that we become aware of \Deleted messages), so the
